Create a stored procedure to manage the status of books in a library system. 
Description: Write a stored procedure that updates the status of a book in the library based on its issuance. 
The procedure should function as follows: The stored procedure should take the book_id as an input parameter.
 The procedure should first check if the book is available (status = 'yes'). If the book is available, it should be
 issued, and the status in the books table should be updated to 'no'. If the book is not available (status = 'no'), 
 the procedure should return an error message indicating that the book is currently not available. */
